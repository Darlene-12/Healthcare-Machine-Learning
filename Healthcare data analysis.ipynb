Key features include location data (latitude, longitude, altitude) for 5,805 entries, and a timestamp for 6,010 entries. Demographic details like Age (6,140 entries), Gender (6,141), Marital Status (6,140), and Employment Status (6,134) are present, with some missing values.\n",

Preventive care participation, such as routine check-ups and cancer screenings, has substantial missing data for the frequency columns, with only 1,776 and 1,565 non-null values, respectively. Numeric columns like \"How many children do you have?\" (5,533 non-null) and \"Time since last hospital visit\" (6,000 non-null) capture additional insights.\n",

The dataset also includes metadata like \"_id,\" \"_uuid,\" \"_submission_time,\" and \"_status\", which are fully populated. Overall, the dataset is large and detailed but contains missing values in key fields related to healthcare access and preventive care, requiring preprocessing and cleaning. The total memory usage is approximately 1.5 MB."
